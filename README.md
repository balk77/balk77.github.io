# Button Plus documentation

This site contains unofficial [Button Plus](https://button.plus/) documentation; it uses the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs-template/) theme. 

Go to [https://balk77.github.io/](https://balk77.github.io/) to view this Button Plus documenation.

The landing page of the documentation is [index.md](index.md) in the root of this repo. All other pages are in [docs/](docs/).

Use issues for development.
