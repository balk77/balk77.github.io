Some writing rules:
* Use English language
* Audience is the not-so-technical user; don't dwell into technicalities when it does not add value for the average user
* Add examples and different ways of doing things when applicable.
* Add photos/pictures/screenshots where it makes sense. Copy paste works in the online editor!
* This is documentation for the Button Plus firmware. Keep this documentation independent of any home automation system.
